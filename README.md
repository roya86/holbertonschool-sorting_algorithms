C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

This project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in C and understanding their computational complexity (Big O notation). The goal is to analyze, compare, and optimize different sorting techniques. 

Four types of sorting algorithms
1. Bubble sort
2. insertion sort
3. selection sort
4. Quick sort
